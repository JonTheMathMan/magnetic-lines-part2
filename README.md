# magnetic-lines-part2

This project is still in progress.

## To Do
- [X] write a algorithym function to find the correct growth points for lines to grow away from the north pole.
- [X] make sure the svg elements will scale correctly for absolute positioning (This should be easy I just have never tried it before).
- [ ] rewrite the compass rotation algorithym to guide the growth of magnetic lines.
